### Adding Rotating Beacon to Your Avatar

#### 1. Add the Prefab to Scene

There are different type of prefabs for several usages, please pick the prefab you want as below:

- `Rotating Beacon(Head Only)` - The beacon will always stay on top of avatar's head
- `Rotating Beacon(Full)` - The beacon can be grabbed on *right hand*, and can be put onto the top of avatar's head from *right hand*
- `Rotating Beacon(Full)(Left_Handed)` - The beacon can be grapped on and can be put onto the head from *left hand*

Specifically, the `Full` prefab uses *a bit* more synced parameter than `Head Only` prefab (3 bits -> 4 bits), and it uses `Contact Sender`, `Contact Receiver` and also `VRC Parent Constraint`. `Head Only` prefab is recommended for PC players and players care about performance.

>:warning: **Attention**
>
>Please choose `Full` prefab according to proper hand. Prefabs handle specific hand gestures, if you added a prefab for one hand, and put the beacon onto the other hand, there would be grabbing issues.

Drag and drop the prefab you've selected from project window into your avatar inside hierarchy (We use `Rotating Beacon(Full)` as an example):

![Prefab_In_Avatar](./Assets/Prefab_In_Avatar.webp)

#### 2. Setup the Rotating Beacon

##### 1. Setup for Head Only Prefab

After dragging the prefab, we can see a beacon in the scene, which is 1.5 meters from the ground:

![Beacon_Head_Only_Default_Position](./Assets/Beacon_Head_Only_Default_Position.webp)

###### 1. Adjust the Position for the Beacon

Select `Prefab/Model`<sup>[1]</sup> in hierarchy, use `Move Tool`, `Rotate Tool` and `Scale Tool`<sup>[2]</sup> to adjust the beacon's position and it's size:

![Beacon_Head_Only_Adjust_Position](./Assets/Beacon_Head_Only_Adjust_Position.webp)

Move the beacon on top of avatar's head:

![Beacon_Head_Only_Adjust_Position_Finished](./Assets/Beacon_Head_Only_Adjust_Position_Finished.webp)

After doing this, you can check out [Extra Setup](#3-extra-setup).

##### 2. Setup for Full Prefab

In this Section, we use `Rotating Beacon(Full)` as an example, which is for right hand.

After adding the prefab, There will be a beacon 1.5 meters from the ground, and a Contact Sender shown as yellow sphere near the corresponding hand:

![Beacon_Full_Default_Position](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Default_Position.webp)

###### 1. Adjust Beacon's Position On Avatar's Head

Select `Prefab/Constraint Parents/Head`<sup>[1]</sup> in hierarchy, use `Move Tool`, `Rotate Tool` and `Scale Tool`<sup>[2]</sup> to adjust the beacon's position and it's size:

![Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Head](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Head.webp)

Move the beacon on top of avatar's head:

![Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Head_Finished](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Head_Finished.webp)

###### 2. Adjust Beacon's Position On Avatar's Hand

As we are able to switch the beacon between avatar's head and hand with `Full` Prefab, we need to adjust it's position on corresponding hand.

Select `Prefab/Model`<sup>[1]</sup>, go to Inspector and find component `VRC Parent Constraint`<sup>[2]</sup>. Inside the component, there's a source list, change the `Weight` of `Element 0 [Head]` to `0`<sup>[3]</sup>, then change the `Weight` of `Element 1 [Hand]` into `1`<sup>[4]</sup>:

![Beacon_Full_Set_Constraint_Hand](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Set_Constraint_Hand.webp)

As we can see, the beacon moves to near the corresponding hand:

![Beacon_Full_Set_Constraint_Hand_Scene](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Set_Constraint_Hand_Scene.webp)

Select `Prefab/Constraint Parents/Hand`, move it to avatar's hand. The reference for the position:

![Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Hand_Finished](./Assets/Beacon_Full_Adjust_Position_Hand_Finished.webp)

###### 3. Adjust Hand's Contact Sender and Head's Contact Receiver

Sender on hand and receiver on head are used to consider where the beacon should be when it moves between hand and head. We need to adjust them according to the positions and scales of avatar's corresponding hand and head, generally, making them larger than hand and head ensures the condition passes with less strictness (If they are too small, the Sender might not be able to contact the Receiver due to controller positioning issues while using with VR headset).

Select `Prefab/Constraint Parents/Hand/Contact Sender`, use `Move Tool` and `Scale Tool` (Or set Position and Radius in Contact Sender component) to adjust the postition and the size of the Sender. Example:

![Adjust_Contact_Sender_Example](./Assets/Adjust_Contact_Sender_Example.webp)

Select `Prefab/Constraint Parents/Head/Contact Receiver`, use `Move Tool` and `Scale Tool` (Or set Position and Radius in Contact Receiver component) to adjust the postition and the size of the Receiver. Example:

![Adjust_Contact_Receiver_Example](./Assets/Adjust_Contact_Receiver_Example.webp)

##### 3. Extra Setup

###### 1. Change the Submenu Position in Action Menu

By default, the submenu for rotating beacon is at the root of Action Menu, which is not friendly to avatars having lots of gimmicks. We can change the position by setting up `MA Menu Installer` component:

- Select `Prefab/Menu/Rotating Beacon`
- Go to Inspector, click on `Select Menu` button in `MA Menu Installer` component
- Select the menu you want to place into

###### 2. Hide the Beacon in VRChat Avatar Preview

The avatar preview in VRChat shows the final state of the avatar in Unity. Which means, if the beacon has not been disabled in Unity, it would also be shown in VRChat avatar preview. We can hide the beacon in Unity and VRChat avatar preview by doing these:

- Select `Prefab/Model`
- Uncheck the checkbox at the top of Inspector (Disable the beacon)

###### 3. Adjust the Sound Clip and Volume When the Beacon is On

Find `Prefab/Model/Bulb/Audio` in Hierarchy, then find the `Audio Source` component in Inspector. If you need to replace the sound clip, drag the imported new sound clip into the `AudioClip` field; If you need to adjust the volume, just adjust the `Volume` in the component.

## How to Use

You've finished the installation, let's talk about how to use it in VRChat.

### Show/Hide the Rotating Beacon

Open the Action Menu, find and enter the `Rotating Beacon` submenu, the `Rotating Beacon` toggle in the submenu is for showing/hiding the rotating beacon.

### Move the Beacon between Head and Hand (For Full Prefab Only)

After showing the rotating beacon, the beacon can be on top of head or on hand:

- When the beacon is on your hand, make sure the hand is not open and move it above your head (Specifically into the head Contact Receiver), then open the hand, the beacon would be on top of your head.
- When the beacon is on top of your head, make sure the corresponding hand is not in fist and move it above your head (Specifically into the head Contact Receiver), then make the hand into fist, the beacon would be on the corresponding hand.

In addition to the above, you can also use the `On Head` switch in the `Rotating Beacon` submenu to toggle the position of the rotating beacon.

### Turn on/off the Rotating Beacon

The `Activate` toggle in the submenu is for turning on/off the beacon, and the `Siren` toggle is for turning on/off the siren sound while the beacon is on.
