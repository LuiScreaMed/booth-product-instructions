##### 3. Extra Setup

###### 1. Change the Submenu Location in Action Menu (Optional)

By default, the submenu for rocket puncher is at the root of Action Menu, which is not friendly to avatars having lots of gimmicks. We can change the location by setting up `MA Menu Installer` component:

- Select the rocket puncher in Hierarchy window
- Go to Inspector, click on the `Select Menu` button in `MA Menu Installer` component
- Select the menu where you want to place the submenu into

###### 2. Hide the Rocket Puncher in VRChat Avatar Preview (Optional)

The avatar preview in VRChat shows the final state of the avatar in Unity. Which means, if the rocket puncher has not been disabled in Unity, it would also be shown in VRChat avatar preview. We can hide the rocket puncher in Unity and VRChat avatar preview by doing these:

- Select `Rocket Puncher/Model` and `Rocket Puncher/PB` in Hierarchy window
- Uncheck the checkbox at the top of Inspector (Disable the rocket puncher)

### Pop out(Fire) the Boxing Glove

Grab the `rear grip`<sup>[1]</sup> with your left hand would drive the rocket puncher into `Standby` state. At this point, when you make your `right hand` into fist, the boxing glove will pop out. When your `right hand` is no longer a fist, the glove will return.
