### Installing Lemon Tea

#### 1. Add Prefab to Scene

This gimmick contains:

- **Normal Edition**
  Which can show/hide with action menu toggle.
- **Squeezable While Holding Fist Edition**
  Which... is squeezable while holding fist...

And left-handed editions, 4 editions in total.

The prefab names for each editions:

- Normal Edition: `Lemon_Tea_MA.prefab`
- Squeezable Edition: `Lemon_Tea_Squeeze_MA.prefab`
- Normal Edition (Left-handed): `Lemon_Tea_Left_Handed_MA.prefab`
- Squeezable Edition (Left-handed): `Lemon_Tea_Left_Handed_Squeeze_MA.prefab`

This instruction will use the squeezable edition as an example.

Drag `Assets/LuiStudio/Lemon Tea/Lemon_Tea_Squeeze_MA.prefab` (Or prefab of other editions) from project window into your avatar locates in hierarchy, it should looks like this after the drag:

![Prefab](./Assets/Prefab.webp)

#### 2. Reposition

##### 1. Asign the Animator Controller for your Avatar

> :warning: **Attention**
>
> This step is for adjusting both lemon tea's position and the gesture holding lemon tea, when in animation preview.
>
> This step is **temporary**. Although VRChat will ignore the controller inside your avatar's animator, please revert the controller after the whole installation if you can.

The Animator Controller names for each edition:

- Normal Edition: `LemonTeaAnimatorGesture`
- Squeezable Edition: `LemonTeaSqueezeAnimatorGesture`
- Normal Edition (Left-handed): `LemonTeaLeftHandedAnimatorGesture`
- Squeezable Edition (Left-handed): `LemonTeaLeftHandedSqueezeAnimatorGesture`

Head to `Assets/LuiStudio/Lemon Tea/Animations/Controllers` in project window, drag `LemonTeaSqueezeAnimatorGesture`<sup>[1]</sup> (Or animator controller of other editions) into your avatar's<sup>[2]</sup> (Sample_Avatar for example) Animator's Controller<sup>[3]</sup>, you should see the result below after you've done it:

![Gesture_Controller_Drag](./Assets/Gesture_Controller_Drag.webp)

##### 2. Enable Animation Preview

Select your avatar<sup>[1]</sup> (Sample_Avatar for example) in Hierarchy, and click "Preview" in the animation window<sup>[2]</sup>. The scene<sup>[3]</sup> should looks like this after the step:

>:warning: **Attention**
>
>If you don't see the Animation Window, right click on the tab of the Project Window -> Add Tab -> Animation.

![Animation_Preview](./Assets/Animation_Preview.webp)

##### 3. Reposition the Lemon Tea

Select `Model/Lemon_Tea`<sup>[1]</sup> in prefab located in Hierarchy, use the `Move Tool`, `Rotate Tool` and `Scale Tool`<sup>[2]</sup> to reposition the lemon tea:

![Adjust_Position](./Assets/Adjust_Position.webp)

Position the lemon tea until you're happy. Such as the image below:

![Adjust_Position_Finished](./Assets/Adjust_Position_Finished.webp)

##### 4. Adjust the Gesture Holding Lemon Tea

After following the steps above, we might see fingers clipping into lemon tea carton, that looks cheap. We need to adjust the gesture to make our avatar "holding" the carton.
Click on the first keyframe<sup>[1]</sup> in animation window, set the fingers' angles to make the hand visibly holding the carton:

![Adjust_Gesture](./Assets/Adjust_Gesture.webp)

Adjust the gesture until you're happy. Such as image below:

![Adjust_Gesture_Finished](./Assets/Adjust_Gesture_Finished.webp)

>:warning: **Attention**
>
>If you are not satisfying with the result. You can repeat [Step 3](#3-reposition-the-lemon-tea) and [Step 4](#4-adjust-the-gesture-holding-lemon-tea) to find the best postiion and gesture.

##### 5. Adjust the Gesture Squeezing Lemon Tea

>:warning: **Attention**
>
>If you choose to install normal editions, please skip and follow [Disable Preview and Revert Animator Controller](#6-disable-preview-and-revert-animator-controller).

Select `Model/Lemon Tea/Lemon_Tea`<sup>[1]</sup> in prefab located in Hierarchy, set `Skinned Mesh Renderer -> BlendShapes -> Squeeze` to `100`<sup>[2]</sup>:

![Shape_Key_100](./Assets/Shape_Key_100.webp)

After that, the carton in the scene will be slightly squeezedï¼š

![Squeezed_Lemon_Tea](./Assets/Squeezed_Lemon_Tea.webp)

Copy and paste the first keyframe's data to the last keyframe:
Select your avatar<sup>[1]</sup> in Hierarchy, click on the first keyframe<sup>[2]</sup> in animation window. Press `Ctrl + C` to copy the keyframe, set the timeline to `60`<sup>[3]</sup> and hit `Enter`, then click on the last keyframe<sup>[4]</sup> of the animation and press `Ctrl + V` to paste the frame data.
Adjust fingers' angles to make the hand visibly squeezing the carton:

![Adjust_Gesture_Squeeze](./Assets/Adjust_Gesture_Squeeze.webp)

Adjust the gesture until you're happy. Such as image below:

![Adjust_Gesture_Squeeze_Finished](./Assets/Adjust_Gesture_Squeeze_Finished.webp)

Select `Model/Lemon Tea/Lemon_Tea`<sup>[1]</sup> in prefab located in Hierarchy, and set `Skinned Mesh Renderer -> BlendShapes -> Squeeze` back to `0`<sup>[2]</sup>:

![Shape_Key_0](./Assets/Shape_Key_0.webp)

##### 6. Disable Preview and Revert Animator Controller

Select your avatar<sup>[1]</sup> and disable preview<sup>[2]</sup> in animation window:

![Animation_Cancel_Preview](./Assets/Animation_Cancel_Preview.webp)

(Optional) Select your avatar<sup>[1]</sup>, revert the animator controller to previous<sup>[2]</sup> (None for example):

![Gesture_Controller_Reset](./Assets/Gesture_Controller_Reset.webp)

##### 7. (Optional) Hide the Lemon Tea

If you don't want the lemon tea to be visible in avatar preview in VRChat, please follow steps below:

Select `Model/Lemon Tea`<sup>[1]</sup> in prefab located in Hierarchy, and deactivate it<sup>[2]</sup> in Inspector:

![Hide_Lemon_Tea](./Assets/Hide_Lemon_Tea.webp)

##### 8. Reposition the Mouth Contact Receiver

This gimmick use `Contact Sender` and `Contact Receiver` to simulate the straw tracking the mouth (Without occupying DPS, SPS etc.). This step is for moving `Contact Receiver` to your avatar's mouth.

Select `Receiver/Mouth`<sup>[1]</sup> in prefab located in Hierarchy, use the `Move Tool` and `Rotate Tool`<sup>[2]</sup> to reposition the receiver:

![Adjust_Mouth_Position](./Assets/Adjust_Mouth_Position.webp)

Move the receiver to avatar's mouth, as image below:
